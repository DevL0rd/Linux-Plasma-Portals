# Linux-Plasma-Portals

A pair of native KDE Plasma 6 widgets: a category-filtered **app launcher** with a
rich, animated **games view** (Steam art, multiple layouts, friend presence), and a
**Steam friends list** with live presence, avatars and quick actions.

This is mostly for myself, but in case my friends use it, here are the instructions.

## Widgets

| Widget | Shows |
|--------|-------|
| **App Portal**   | App launcher with a category dropdown (Favorites / All Applications / Development / …, driven by the same kicker models Plasma's own launcher uses) **plus** a Games view that renders your Steam library — grid, list, shelf, 3D carousel/cover-flow, and banners — with resolved Steam art. Search + sorting everywhere, Ctrl+scroll to zoom, "last opened" tracking, right-click for custom art and per-game actions. Games where a **friend is online** get a green glow + badge, and an additive **"Friends online only"** filter. |
| **Steam Friends** | Live friends list with avatars and presence (in-game / online / away / offline), grouped into **Favourites / In Game / Online / Offline** sections. Per-friend right-click: Open Chat, Join Game, Watch Game, View Profile, and add/remove **Favourite** (pinned to the top). Right side shows in-game art, a country flag, or "last online". Panel icon carries an online-count badge. |

Each widget keeps its own per-instance settings (view mode, sort, filters, zoom,
favourites) — so multiple copies on your panel/desktop don't interfere.

## How it works (and why it's light)

The widgets don't each do their own heavy lifting. Small helpers in `bin/` do the work
and the widgets read cached snapshots:

* **`portal-games`** resolves your Steam library + artwork, tracks "last opened",
  and stores favourites/custom art.
* **`portal-friends`** is a resident systemd **user service** that polls the Steam
  Web API and writes a JSON snapshot to `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`. Both widgets read that
  one snapshot, so whether you run one widget or both, Steam sees about **one poll
  per interval**. The service is niced and pinned to the CPU's efficiency cores
  (via `portal-ecores`), same as the router/log collectors.
* The Friends widget reads the snapshot **in-process** (QML XHR over `file://`, no
  subprocess per poll) and reconciles its list **in place** keyed by SteamID, so
  rows update without being destroyed and recreated.

## Requirements

* KDE Plasma 6 (Qt 6)
* `python3`, `kpackagetool6`
* A free **Steam Web API key** for the friends features (badges, glow, the Friends
  widget). The launcher and games art work without it.

## Installation

Clone **with submodules** — the shared QML components live in the
[Linux-Plasma-Shared](https://github.com/DevL0rd/Linux-Plasma-Shared) submodule:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/DevL0rd/Linux-Plasma-Portals.git
# already cloned without it?  git submodule update --init --recursive
./install.sh
```

Then add your Steam Web API key (get one free at
<https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey> — any domain works in the form):

```bash
~/.config/Plasma-App-Portal/config.json
```

```jsonc
{
  "steam_api_key": "PASTE_YOUR_STEAM_WEB_API_KEY_HERE",
  "steamid": "",          // auto-detected from the Steam client; set only to override
  "poll_interval": 10     // seconds between Steam Web API polls
}
```

You can also paste the key straight into the **Steam Friends** widget — it shows a
setup panel with an input box when it can't authenticate, and reloads the collector
for you.

Add the widgets via **right-click → Add Widgets → search "App Portal" / "Steam Friends"**.

> The config file holds your API key and is **git-ignored**.

## Uninstallation

```bash
./uninstall.sh
```

Removes the widgets, the `~/.local/bin` links and the friends service. Your config
(with the API key) and any custom game art in `~/.local/share/Plasma-App-Portal`
are kept.

## Layout

```
bin/portal-games        Steam library + art resolver, favourites, usage tracking
bin/portal-friends      Steam Web API presence collector (--serve resident service)
bin/portal-ecores       detects efficiency cores to pin the collector to
plasmoids/              the two Plasma 6 applets (App Portal + Steam Friends)
config.example.json     template copied to ~/.config/Plasma-App-Portal/config.json
```

## Notes

* **Steam friend "favourites" are our own.** Steam doesn't expose its favourites or
  friend categories through the Web API (or any readable config), so the Friends
  widget keeps its own per-instance favourites instead.
* **"Last online" can be inaccurate** — Steam fuzzes/hides `lastlogoff`, so some
  offline friends show stale values. That's Steam's data, not a bug here.
* The friends presence service only reports friends whose game details are public.
  "Join Game" is a best-effort `steam://` call; the real lobby token isn't on the
  Web API, so it may not connect for every game.
